01:57 < zen> that should be very possible
01:57 < [_]> the issue with ashtrays/joint holders is that none of this plastic is 'food safe'

01:59 < [_]> it isn't so much about 'hardness' as it is about the chemical makeup
01:59 < embri0n> awkay... 
01:59 < zen> but i dunno i slack so much atm the days are melting together in one big blurry

02:18 < zen> haha
02:20 < [_]> nobody has printed anything too risque at skull.space yet.
02:20 < KillerBong> i feel like camping

02:20 < KillerBong> and tenting
02:20 < [_]> when we first got our roll of NinjaFlex ( rubber that stretches 15x its size ) there was talk about printing a dildo.  nobody wanted to model for it.
02:21 < oorza> Random it's WASD + cursor
02:21 < [_]> KillerBong, Rust IRL
02:21 < oorza> Random or double joystick
02:21 < [_]> KillerBong, start naked and scavenge the rest.
02:22 < zen> haha why not model for it.. you could always enhance the size a few times :D
02:22 < zen> [_]: it would be cool to make my own kitchen tool and cutlery etc :)
02:23 < [_]> zing!
02:24 < [_]> zen, yeah there are a lot of kitchen/home gadgets
02:24 < zen> or like differently shaped baking molds 
02:25 < zen> i think the gourmet boys would love it if they could just order and print some fancy mold shapes in a day :D
02:29 < [_]> yep
02:32 < [_]> the possibilities are pretty endless
02:32 < [_]> i am always amazed at the ingenuity of the community too.  there is always some new and intereting object on the horizon
02:33 < zen> yeap i kinda envy your toys :)
02:34 < zen> not the pickle shredder but the one you make it with lol
02:34 < [_]> i would never be able to afford it on my own.  it is only the collective power of skull.space that lets me enjoy it.
02:36 < zen> ya that's what i ment who cares who owns it as long as you can play :)

03:30 < slew> would you make an anvil using a forge
03:32 < Resinator> no
03:35 < Resinator> i want one of those massive 1000lbs+ ones 
03:35 < deadmind> can you use a forge to forge a forge?
03:36 < Resinator> i watched one episode of forged in fire with a filipino guy
03:37 < Resinator> and his home forge was like a modified grill with a minidish satellite on top of it and a hole cut in it that had a hose attached to a blow dryer and he put charcoal in it

19:21 < azk> deadmind: It is
19:21 < Grenwolth> you mwouldn't have woke up just for pe nnicillin
19:21 < deadmind> unless you consider coffee a painkiller
19:21 < deadmind> it's not pennicilin

19:22 < deadmind> i want neither to lose my hand due to infection nor to spend the next 2 years trying to un-break my digestive system

21:24 < azk> beard braids feel weird
21:25 < StolenToast> have you guys heard about this trump immigration order?
21:25 < StolenToast> it's turning into a MASSIVE deal
21:25 < azk> Yes
21:25 < azk> trump only makes the best deals
21:25 < StolenToast> it's all the articles on the front pages of the news sites I see
21:25 < azk> tremendous deals
21:26 < StolenToast> not just one or two, like 10 or 12
21:26 < StolenToast> a federal judge even granted a deferral to the order for certain legal non-citizens
21:27 < StolenToast> when two last-ditch immediate powers have to be utilized in one day...
21:27 < StolenToast> fuck it's not even 10 days in
21:29 < embri0n> he makes the best deals FAST 
21:30 < StolenToast> it's not much different from france's "emergency powers" britain's May who seems to be able to do absolutely anything
21:30 < StolenToast> it's like we're living in a martial law state
21:30 < StolenToast> a couple people get to decide how things change are going to be done from now on
21:31 < StolenToast> for me, this has pushed the "leaving the country" idea from "stop overreacting" to "ok maybe we should make a list..."
21:31 < StolenToast> the only consolation I have is that I don't think my government cares about people in my situation
21:32 < StolenToast> not rich enough to influence law and not poor enough to influence media
21:32 < StolenToast> white and a normie straight dude

21:32 < StolenToast> I can't kill a black man any more
21:33 < StolenToast> there was a time when I could
21:36 < StolenToast> we've got a really federal-law heavy government right now and I think it's about the biggest problem the US has
21:37 < StolenToast> I do want to say, it's fun to rant every now and then but this stuff doesn't really get to me
21:37 < StolenToast> I know people who feel miserable and have stopped reading news
