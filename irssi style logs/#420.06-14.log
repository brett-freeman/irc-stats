00:01 <@ranunculoid> I'm going to get high brb
00:01 <@Borbus> Oh yeah... someone the other day threw up
00:01 < Random> I once ate a huge casserole in one sitting
00:01 < Random> i was so full it hurt bad
00:01 <@Borbus> Because they ate about a ton of chips
00:01 < Random> but chewing and swallowing was better than sex
00:01 < Random> so I kept doing it
00:01 < Random> but the pain!
00:01 < Random> heh
00:01 <@Borbus> Yeah
00:01 <@Borbus> I had to stop myself the other night
00:01 <@Borbus> Because it was starting to hurt..
00:01 < Random> now that I've moved out its no problem
00:01 <@Borbus> But I really really wanted to eat
00:01 < Random> I just don't have food in the house :/
00:01 <@Borbus> lol, yeah
00:02 <@Borbus> I have a habit of stealing when that happens..

12:22 < ranunculoid> Ok guys I'm smoking this weed and it's the best motherfucking weed I've ever smoked in my life - it's getting me really nicely stoned. Now my pupils are really small and my arms and legs are itchy as fuck, has this ever happened anyone else with really good weed or is this shit laced with heroin? Has anyone else ever smoked laced weed?
12:23 < ilias> heh, can't wait for an answer on the forum heh?
12:26 < ranunculoid> nope, I can't wait:-P
12:27 < ranunculoid> It's really good and now it's all gone, and my dealer is going away tomorrow and I won't be seeing him before then.
13:22 < R[a]ndom> itchy eh?
13:26 < R[a]ndom> if its more than just a little bit, id say its laced :
13:33 < ranunculoid> Really fuckin itchy
13:34 < ranunculoid> cool, now I can add heroin to the "list of drugs I've taken".
13:35 < R[a]ndom> ..maybe
14:06 < ranunculoid> Everyone in this channell needs to watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcKj9JKw2lM
14:50 <@Borbus> Packing ftl...
14:51 <@Borbus> ranunculoid: yeah, once I had such a good high that I thought it was laced with heroin...
14:51 <@Borbus> But I don't think that would work anyway lol
14:54 <@Borbus> But if it's made your pupils small then that's weird...
15:02 < ranunculoid> Borbus: But the itchy thing. My friend got it too. Couldn't stop scratching...
15:03 < ranunculoid> I've never had that happen to me with just cannabis
15:04 <@Borbus> Yeah.. same
15:04 <@Borbus> And weed makes your pupils dilate
15:04 < ranunculoid> no it doesn't
15:04 < ranunculoid> just makes em bloodshot
15:04 <@Borbus> Well.. it definitely doesn't make them small
15:05 <@Borbus> Alcohol makes them dilate..
15:05 < ranunculoid> yeah
15:05 <@Borbus> Or does it..
15:05 <@Borbus> Can't say I've ever looked at my pupils
15:06 <@Borbus> What.. according to wikipedia alcohol makes them small
15:07 <@Borbus> Psychedellics make them dilate... doesn't say weed though
15:07 <@Borbus> But opiates and alcohol make them small
15:08 < ranunculoid> well they were really small. Erowid says nothing about scratching or small eyes in the effects list for cannabis
15:08 <@Borbus> Did everything go dark..?
15:08 < ranunculoid> what do you mean "Packing ftl"?
15:08 <@Borbus> Oh.. packing stuff for moving out
15:09 < ranunculoid> no, it seemed about the same brightess
15:09 <@Borbus> Things seem brighter with weed that's why I thought they were dilated
15:09 < ranunculoid> I got so stoned I forgot to buy the weed off him, just been smoking a bit he gave me for free
15:10 < ranunculoid> I'll head up again tomorrow or the day after.
15:10 < ranunculoid> I wanna buy as uch of this weed as I can afford:-D
15:10 <@Borbus> Is the itchiness anoying?
15:11 < ranunculoid> a bit
15:11 < ranunculoid> I smoke the last of it last night and I'm still a little itchy today

19:20 < mikeyribbs> and he's really conservative, he told me if he catches me smoking he's not paying for shit

19:22 < mikeyribbs> True
19:22 < dj_smilee> how old?
19:22 <@Borbus> My parents don't want me to smoke in their house, which is fair enough, but they don't care that I do
19:22 <@Borbus> I will use the vape in the house though
19:23 <@Borbus> Far too many people just blindly think drugs are bad
19:24 <@Borbus> A lot of them binge drink too

19:26 < ranunculoid> They don't mind
19:26 <@Borbus> They will know about any drugs I do probably
19:26 <@Borbus> My dad doesn't care because he used to smoke weed anyway
19:26 < ranunculoid> In fact I smoke it with my dad sometimes
19:26 <@Borbus> My mum wasn't too happy about it
19:27 -!- mikeyribbs [~Michael_R@206-30.9-67.tampabay.res.rr.com] has joined #420
19:27 < ranunculoid> neither of my parents cared about weed
19:27 <@Borbus> But I just said to my mum... you used gas and air when you had me.. which is a drug.. so what's wrong with me taking a drug for pleasure?
19:27 <@Borbus> And she understoof
19:27 <@Borbus> *d
19:28 < ranunculoid> My mum got scared when she found out I take pills (I was 16 at the time)
19:28 < mikeyribbs> what did she say?
19:28 < ranunculoid> She caught me a few times taking them
19:28 < ranunculoid> She was like "It's dangerous, I don't want you taking them!"
19:29 < mikeyribbs> and you were like, uhh don't care
19:29 <@Borbus> My mum probably wouldn't be too happy if I said about trying to find some E.. but I'd just explain to her that it's not actually dangerous.. just good
19:29 <@Borbus> A lot of people are kind of brainwashed about drugs
19:29 < mikeyribbs> Because they think it's too good to be true
19:29 < ranunculoid> I sat her down and showed informed her of the stats. That it's one of the safest rec. drugs, far safer than alcohol
19:29 < ranunculoid> That was a while ago
19:30 <@Borbus> Yeah.. with weed you've just got to say that nobody has ever died from weed.. for any reason
19:30 <@Borbus> People have died from alcohol
19:30 < mikeyribbs> thats true
19:31 < mikeyribbs> I know, but I guess parents don't want their kids getting in trouble witht he law
19:31 < mikeyribbs> because of the legality issue
19:32 <@Borbus> Lol.. well my dad grew weed in the greenhouse so he doesn't care much about the law
19:32 <@Borbus> Fuckinh law and pigs
19:32 <@Borbus> Luckily you can't really get in trouble for cannabis posession in the UK any more
19:32 < ranunculoid> I was grabbing a water bottle from my fridge prepring for my candyflip and my friend started talking, I wrote a note to him saying to shut up about the water and to discreetly stick it in his bag (my mum was in the room) or mum'll be suspicious.
19:32 < ranunculoid> My mum found the note later on
19:33 <@Borbus> lol...
19:33 < ranunculoid> I was informed of this by a text from my sis while totally wired
19:33 < ranunculoid> I thought I'd be in shit when I got home but my mam didn't care
19:34 <@Borbus> Good parents ftw :D
19:34 < ranunculoid> I didn't tell her I took acid, but I told my dad
19:34 < ranunculoid> I don't think I;'ll be telling either that I'm getting heroin laced hash/weed
19:34 < ranunculoid> ;-)
19:35 <@Borbus> Only thing I don't like about drugs is the peer pressure and stuff associated with it..
19:35 < ranunculoid> It turns out that my source for this magnificant weed isn't leaving till monday. I'm gonna buy as much as I can afford
19:36 <@Borbus> Luckily I never give in to pressure
19:36 <@Borbus> I do research and decide what I want to take
19:36 < ranunculoid> I don't get affected by peer pressure, I'll take anything as long as I know what it is heh
19:36 < ranunculoid> What wouldn't you take/
19:36 < ranunculoid> ?
19:36 < ranunculoid> That you get pressured about?
19:36 <@Borbus> Anything addictive
19:37 < ranunculoid> Everything is addictive to an extent
19:37 <@Borbus> Oh, I got pressured into smoking weed and tobacco years ago
19:37 <@Borbus> I didn't though
19:37 <@Borbus> Then about a year ago I became curious and researched and smoked on my own
19:37 < ranunculoid> You've never smoked a joint with tobacco in it?
19:37 <@Borbus> Yes I have... but I don't like it
19:38 <@Borbus> I only would if somebody else rolls
19:38 <@Borbus> Don't want to be rude ;)
19:38 <@Borbus> But I will never smoke tobacco on its own
19:38 <@Borbus> I don't see the point really.. just smoke weed
19:38 < mikeyribbs> tobacco is easier to come by
19:39 < ranunculoid> Don't you put a little tobacco in to help the weed burn? I like 85% weed 15% tobacco.
19:39 <@Borbus> Well I don't smoke joints any mroe
19:39 <@Borbus> When I did I rolled them up with just weed
19:39 <@Borbus> You just have to light it before evey toke
19:39 < dj_smilee> ordered a downpipe yet Borbus? :S
19:39 < ranunculoid> I love pure weed joints. It's like smoking a pipe
19:40 <@Borbus> I will do in a few days.. when I'm at home
19:40 < ranunculoid> but lasts longer
19:40 < dj_smilee> pure weed shotties
19:40 < dj_smilee> better in a pipe tho ;)
19:40 <@Borbus> Yeah.. with pure weed joints you get through far too much weed
19:40 < dj_smilee> all this talk...
19:40 < dj_smilee> bong time :D
19:41 <@Borbus> Oh some dude is bringing his bubbler to mine tonight
19:41 <@Borbus> If I like that, I'll like a bong right..?
19:42 < mikeyribbs> I want a bubbler
19:43 <@Borbus> I'm probably going to get a huge roor bong if I like my home made bong which I'll make soon..
19:44 < dj_smilee> sooo expensive tho
19:44 < dj_smilee> sweet Borbus :D
19:44 < mikeyribbs> but it is sooooo cool
19:44 < dj_smilee> true
19:44 < dj_smilee> what is a bubbler?
19:44 < ilias> google it
19:44 < mikeyribbs> a pipe witha space below for water
19:44 <@Borbus> ranunculoid: the guy who did E and LSD both for the first time... did he enjoy it?
19:44 < dj_smilee> ah
19:44 < ilias> glasspiece
19:45 <@Borbus> It's basically like a little one piece bong isn't it?
19:45 < mikeyribbs> yeah
19:45 < ilias> kindof
19:45 < mikeyribbs> and you can operate it by your self
19:45 <@Borbus> But with no chamber
19:45 < ilias> indeed
19:45 < dj_smilee> looks cool
19:45 < ilias> mikeyribbs: you can operate a bong by yourself as well.. 
19:45 < dj_smilee> i've got a phallic glass pipe...
19:46 < dj_smilee> dont use it much tho
19:46 < mikeyribbs> most glass pipes are
19:47 <@Borbus> If you've got a bong with a huge chamber.. wouldn't you have to suck out all the air first.. then take a hit..?
19:47 < dj_smilee> http://www.everyonedoesit.co.uk/online_headshop/Cone_Roller_Pipe.cfm?iProductID=1926&iProductCategoryID=278
19:47 < dj_smilee> the whole chamber fills :D
19:47 < dj_smilee> and your lungs are massive dude
19:47 < ilias> Borbus: chamber fills, you exhale, you inhale what's in the chamber
19:47 < ilias> kindog
19:48 <@Borbus> Oh yeah.. actually I remember testing my lung capacity once
19:48 < ilias> dj_smilee: sucks, it's not such a good pipe :p
19:48 <@Borbus> On this massive plastic tube thing
19:48 <@Borbus> And the capacity is masive
19:48 < dj_smilee> yeah ilias it gets dirty quick :( only for out and about
19:49 < dj_smilee> http://www.everyonedoesit.co.uk/online_headshop/Streetdaddy_Blue.cfm?iProductID=26&iProductCategoryID=7
19:49 < dj_smilee> i used to have that, SO annoying to clean, but very cool :D
20:02 < ranunculoid> Borbus: yes, he enjoyed it a LOT. E produces the best high in the world, pure empathy and love, acid magnifys emotions. WIN.
20:03 < ranunculoid> His brain was orgasming
20:03 <@Borbus> I think I'd rather build up to it first
20:03 < ranunculoid> no need really.
20:03 <@Borbus> Doing them both seems like wasting the individual experiences
20:04 < ranunculoid> not at all
20:04 <@Borbus> Well I'm definitely going to get some E
20:04 <@Borbus> What are prices like for E in the UK?
20:04 < ranunculoid> 2-3£ a pill
20:05 <@Borbus> What.. well cheap
20:05 < ranunculoid> Yeah man
20:05 <@Borbus> What about LSD?
20:05 < ranunculoid> anything up to 12£ a tab
20:05 < ranunculoid> probably 5
20:06 <@Borbus> I'll have to find someone to get it from
20:06 <@Borbus> Unfortunately my main dealer has gone away
20:06 <@Borbus> And i don't know if he had any anyway
20:07 <@Borbus> Right.. I'm having a shower... last party of the year...
20:08 < ranunculoid> Maybe you'll score some E at the party
20:09 <@Borbus> Maybe.. but then I'd have to bunk off and check the pill to see if it's good..
20:10 <@Borbus> I'm really tempted to blaze now..
20:10 <@Borbus> But I won't.. being stoned tends to make me less social
20:53 <@Borbus> Hey ranuky.. I take it you like Guinness?
20:53  * ilias makes "yuk" sounds
20:54 < R[a]ndom> ilias, what you like?
20:55 < ilias> Belgian beer, of course
20:55 < ilias> jupiler, stella artois, duvel
20:55 < ilias> <3
20:55 < R[a]ndom> stella eh? 
20:56 < R[a]ndom> Ive heard duvel being good
20:56 < R[a]ndom> ratebeer says jupiler is trash too.  but I haven't tasted it myself
20:57 < R[a]ndom> I should really pick up some duvel though. thanks for reminding me
20:58 < ilias> jupiler?
20:58 < ilias> TRASH?
20:58 < ilias> what in fuck's name..
20:58 < R[a]ndom> http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/jupiler/8042/
20:58 < ilias> what does it say about heineken?
20:58 < R[a]ndom> trash I assume, cause its skunky
20:58 < R[a]ndom> *checks*
20:58 < R[a]ndom> http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/heineken/37/
21:00 < R[a]ndom> http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/134/349 says jupiler is worth a try tho
21:00 < ilias> omg
21:00 < ilias> really, heineken is the worst beer ever made
21:00 < ilias> and they rate it higher =/
21:00 < R[a]ndom> no it isnt. but its pretty bad :)
21:00 < ilias> (just to mention it, I'm in a beer-tasting club :D)
21:00 < R[a]ndom> there are much worse tho. heh
21:00 < ilias> ok, not the worst
21:00 < ilias> but for being that commercial
21:00 < ilias> =/
21:01 < R[a]ndom> yeah, I have a couple friends who are super into beer.  I'm slowly getting into it
21:01 < R[a]ndom> I just don't have the money
21:01 < R[a]ndom> Drinking unibroue's maudite and sinha stout atm
21:01 < ilias> :)
21:01 < ilias> anyway
21:01 < ilias> back to Weedsd
21:01 < ilias> -d
21:02 < R[a]ndom> hah. indeed
21:02 < dj_smilee> i want a beer
21:02 < R[a]ndom> you in a weed tasting club?
21:02 < R[a]ndom> I want to be.
21:02 < R[a]ndom> I should start one!
21:02 < ilias> :P
21:02 < R[a]ndom> I wonder if I know enough potheads.
21:02 < R[a]ndom> I have access to enough different strains
21:02 < R[a]ndom> then we could taste some beer.  then maybe some coffee to sober up
21:03 <@Borbus> I'm enjoying a warm guinness right now

22:22 < Pagrate> whats the point in them having a torrent site that is invite only, defeats the point of file sharing really
22:23 < ranunculoid> Borbus: I do not like guiness

22:23 < ranunculoid> It makes it way better

22:24 -!- mode/#420 [+o ranunculoid] by Tich
22:24 < Pagrate> but more people = more files to share
22:24 <@ranunculoid> not really
22:24 <@Tich> at a usercount of 160k+ I don't think we lack people :P
22:24 <@ranunculoid> people won't upload new content on public trackers
22:24 -!- Benjamin is now known as Random
22:25 <@ranunculoid> There are nearly 200,000 torrents here
22:25 <@ranunculoid> more torrents than users
22:25 -!- mode/#420 [+v Random] by Tich
22:26 <@ranunculoid> Also, Seeders:	1,539,622
22:27 < Pagrate> 1.688.466 registered users.
22:27 < Pagrate> 4.375.646 peers (2.788.745 leechers + 1.586.901 seeders) in 567.117 torrents on tracker.
22:27 < Pagrate> thats pirate bays stats
22:27 <@ranunculoid> haha
22:27 <+Random> so we have as many seeders
22:27 <@ranunculoid> more leechers than seeders
22:28 <@ranunculoid> that's what's wrong with public sites
22:28 <+Random> and 9% the population. lol
22:28 < Pagrate> more torrents than oink
22:28 < Pagrate> more users
22:28 <+Random> ten times the users. same number of seeds
22:29 <@ranunculoid> So OiNK is 10x better seeded
22:29 <@ranunculoid> hence much faster
22:29 < Pagrate> is oink music only?
22:29 <+Random> look at the categories
22:29 <@ranunculoid> aren't you a member?
22:29 <+Random> the only reason oink doesn't have more torrents are the strict rules.
22:29 <+Random> which is how it should be :P
22:30 <@ranunculoid> Yup, no shit here
22:30 <+Random> oh. voicage.
22:30 < Pagrate> no trying to get membership
22:30 <+Random> when did that happen? :P
22:30 < Pagrate> just stumbled upon the irc network
22:30 <@ranunculoid> Sorry, there are no invites on this server
22:30 <+Random> ah. can't ask for invites. but you can hang out here.
22:30 < Pagrate> didnt ask
22:31 < Pagrate> just looking for clues to where to get invites
22:31 <+Random> ah, 6 mins ago.
22:31 <@ranunculoid> You really need to get them from real life
22:31 <+Random> thx Tich (+v)
22:31 < Pagrate> friend at work has membership but he claims he has no invites left to give
22:31 <+Random> yeah, I got mine in real life
22:31 <+Random> after finding out about oink, I asked everyone I met who knew about torrents
22:32 <@ranunculoid> Tell him to donate, you get 2 invites for your first donation
22:32 <+Random> then some guy I kinda knew was logging into some site, so I was tapping him on the shoulder to ask if he had heard of oink and I noticed oink was on screen
22:32 <@Borbus> oh shit
22:32 <@Borbus> I got way too dunk
22:32 <+Random> lol
22:32 < Pagrate> so if i pay him the donation i could get an invite back from him
22:32 <@ranunculoid> Borbus gonna puke?
22:32 <@Borbus> I dontl ikjn beinbg do dtunk
22:32 <@ranunculoid> Pagrate: you sure could
22:32 < Pagrate> how much is the donation
22:32 <@Borbus> shit
22:32 <+Random> Pagrate, if he has already donated, then a second donation may not net more invites.
22:32 <@Borbus> i dont like bsing so drnk
22:32 <@ranunculoid> Pagrate: 5 British Pounds min
22:33 < Pagrate> is that all?

22:33 < Pagrate> id happily pay more than that
22:33 <+Random> Pagrate, do it once you get a membership
22:33 <+Random> then you get access to advanced search + your own 2 invites
22:34 <+Random> I donated first thing.  Its definitely worth supporting.
22:34 < Pagrate> i expect my friend has already done the first donation

23:04 < Pagrate> im off to see them at glastonbury

23:08 < ranunculoid_> it's handy
23:09 < pezdispenser> ranunculoid_: yeah
23:09 < pezdispenser> :D
23:09 <+Random> hah. indeed it is
23:09 < pezdispenser> ugh, this girl knows EXACTLY how to annoy me, by saying the slightest things
23:09 <+Random> in linux you can do that to commands too
23:09 <+Random> and directories, etc.
23:09 < pezdispenser> sweet
23:10 -!- weirdcrap [~wejfskvmp@pool-72-69-136-232.chi01.dsl-w.verizon.net] has joined #420
23:10 <+Random> what girl?
23:10 < ranunculoid_> Random: yeah same in windows
23:10 < pezdispenser> just an old friend of mine
23:10 < pezdispenser> you can?
23:10 < ranunculoid_> yup
23:10 < pezdispenser> apparently i'm a windows noob too
23:10 < ranunculoid_> in the command line
23:10 <+Random> ranunculoid_, newer shells they added it
23:10 <+Random> be xp pre the latest pack, no you couldn't
23:10 < ranunculoid_> oh right
23:11 <+Random> I know cause I kept hitting tab at work and it would leave a big space instead of fucking completing the folder name
23:11 < pezdispenser> ranunculoid_: do you like post-rock?
23:11 < ranunculoid_> nooooooooooooooo
23:11 < pezdispenser> or radiohead/thom yorke's solo stuff for that matter
23:11 < pezdispenser> kk
23:11 < ranunculoid_> I like sigur ros
23:11 < pezdispenser> who doesn't
23:11 < ranunculoid_> but hate explosions in the sky
23:11 < ranunculoid_> boring
23:12 < pezdispenser> i remember being completely stoned with a bunch of friends and we were flicking through the music channels and sigur ros was on the classical, and i think it was the first time any of my friends had ever seen them
23:12 < pezdispenser> and i think it was Glosoli.. and my friend stopped flicking
23:12 < pezdispenser> put the remote on the couch, and sat and stared.. and slowly started to raise his arms to accept the brilliance that is sigur ros
23:12 < pezdispenser> inevitably, we all had our arms in the air within the next 30 seconds or so
23:12 < ranunculoid_> lol
23:13 -!- ranunculoid_ is now known as ranunculoid
23:13 < ranunculoid> I'm such a slow typer
23:13 <+Random> how fast?
23:13 < ranunculoid> do you guys practice it or what?
23:13 <+Random> you taken a test recently?
23:14 < ranunculoid> no,
23:14 <+Random> not since grade 5
23:14 <+Random> we had typing classes
23:14 <+Random> I was.. 50wpm then I think
23:14 < dj_smilee> msn taught me to type
23:14 < ranunculoid> I's say I'm like 20wpm
23:14 < pezdispenser> we never had typing classes, but i was so ahead in I.T that i taught myself how to touch type, although i don't
23:14 < dj_smilee> and irc
23:14 <+Random> last time I took a test I got 86wpm for large paragraphs, site unseen. and 130 for those short single phrase tests
23:14 < pezdispenser> and i'm not that fast at all really, not as fast as i used to be
23:14 < pezdispenser> i want to take a test now
23:14 < pezdispenser> hoorah]
23:15 <+Random> I bet there are online ones
23:15 <+Random> hah typingtest.com
23:15 < ranunculoid> Lordshaft said that his wife says it sounds like he's mashing the keyboard when he's typing
23:16 <+Random> go take the typingtest.com test. 1 min, zebra, wpm
23:16 < ranunculoid> I'm loading it now
23:17 < mikeyribbs> I"m gunna take it too
23:18 <@Tich> Coldplay - Clocks [Rhythms Del Mundo #01 :: MP3 203KBps ::  5:02] <-- I like this one too
23:18 <@Tich> if you like buena vista social club get this VA album :)
23:18 <+Random> 83wpm :/
23:18 < pezdispenser> 56wpm, but i'm realllly tired.
23:18 < pezdispenser> and i hate this keyboard :@
23:18 <+Random> I swear they caught me on a us/canadian spelling thing tho
23:18 < pezdispenser> screw zebras!
23:18 < ranunculoid> 32 wpm
23:19 < ranunculoid> suckage
23:20 <+Random> 92wpm on the enchanted typewriter
23:20 < pezdispenser> pfft!
23:21 <+Random> I bet if I practiced I could do 100 steady
23:21 < ranunculoid> My auntie taught herself to type at 100 wpm
23:21 <+Random> I should go play typing of the dead. heh
23:21 <+Random> she would be good at typing of the dead then
23:21 < ranunculoid> she's a computer oob
23:21 < ranunculoid> *noob
23:21 <+Random> http://www.mobygames.com/images/i/01/00/262200.jpeg <- screenie of the game
23:22 <+Random> each character shoots the zombie once.
23:22 <+Random> its pretty killer.
23:22 <+Random> ugh. horrible pun not intended
23:23 < pezdispenser> 68wpm on that enchanted thing.. this keyboard is pretty lame for my typing though
23:23 < pezdispenser> it's too flat, can't feel where any of the buttons are
23:23 <+Random> yeah, it makes a big difference.
23:23 <+Random> this one is okay, but not my fav type
23:23 <+Random> the keys go in too far on this one
23:23 <+Random> I like keys with a short throw
23:23 < pezdispenser> these are OK for that, it's just reallllly flat. i originally started typing on a really big chunky dell keyboard
23:24 <+Random> isn't irc annoying at 32wpm ranunculoid?
23:24 < pezdispenser> man, that was one awesome keyboard.
23:24 < ranunculoid> Yeah sort of
23:24 <+Random> I often get annoyed that I cant get my ideas out fast enough
23:24 < ranunculoid> Random: It's ok in a room like this w/o much ppl
23:24 < pezdispenser> i don't think i have enough ideas to have that problem
23:24 <+Random> yeah, I guess a heated debate in a large room would get to be a bit much
23:24 <+Random> hah
23:24 < ranunculoid> In #gentoo on freenode it can be trying lol
23:24 <+Random> you're a gentoo user?!
23:25 <+Random> (gew)
23:25 < ranunculoid> was
23:25 <+Random> ah
23:25 < pezdispenser> what be it
23:25 <+Random> a distro of linux
23:25 < pezdispenser> oh
23:25 <+Random> its just source based, so you have to compile everything
23:25 <+Random> I has some perks, but is mostly a waste of time :)
23:26 <+Random> hm. whats for dinner?
23:26 < ranunculoid> I've been through my fair few distros of linux. But I settled on kubuntu cause I like to use my free time on other stuff than setting up/fixing my computer
23:26 <+Random> xubuntu here ranunculoid 
23:27 < ranunculoid> haven't tried xfce
23:27 <+Random> you shouuuld
23:27 <+Random> I can screenie you if you care
23:27 <+Random> but I really love it.

23:27 <+Random> http://www.pithed.org/newscreen.png
23:28 <+Random> as you can see, I use a lot of KDE apps
23:29 <+Random> I especially love that file manager
23:29 <+Random> its quick, has custom actions (like the one I'm using in the screenie), and you can drag dirs into that bar on the left
23:30 < ranunculoid> My interwebs suck, that screenie will be down in about 5 mins
23:30 <+Random> oh.  sucks to be you on oink then :)
23:30 < ranunculoid> Well I'm torrenting at the same time

23:33 < ranunculoid> I have to get off the internet when the family wants to use the voip
23:33 <+Random> I have to do that here too, just cause I cant be assed to set up QOS
23:33 < ranunculoid> nah it used to be faster
23:34 <+Random> well, I drop the up speed in az to 30k or so

23:50 < ranunculoid> nah
23:50 <+Random> hah
23:50 <@Tich> you should see him talk about rather boring plants... so much enthusiasm and geniune fascination about a rather boring subject
23:50 < ranunculoid> it gave up

23:51 <@Tich> holy crap.. that's a huge res!
23:52 < ranunculoid> how big is your screen?
23:52 <+Random> 19"x2
23:52 <+Random> 3200x1200
23:52 <@Tich> isn't that really tiny text?

23:52 < ranunculoid> 19x2
23:52 < ranunculoid> dual display
23:53 <+Random> nah, its perfect for me
23:53 <+Random> yeah
23:53 <@Tich> yeah I know, but 1600x1200 per screen is too tiny imo
23:53 <@Tich> 1680x1050 for 22" WS = perfect :)
23:53 <+Random> I have good eyes I guess
23:53 <+Random> I like the higher dpi

23:54 <@Tich> and a 17" TFT for irc/putty
23:54 <+Random> 80hz here
23:54 <+Random> any less and I can see it flash
23:54 < ranunculoid> yeah mine's at 100Hz
23:54 <@Tich> yeah, TFTs are fine at 60hz though
23:54 <@Tich> crt I need at least 85hz

23:55 <+Random> I reupped that screenie
23:55 <+Random> its a good one, but cut down quality now

23:55 <+Random> I'm happy enough my video card can do that
23:55 <+Random> thats a lot of pixels per second
