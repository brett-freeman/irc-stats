[00:43:38] <StolenToast> the one on the right looks like a professional of state

[00:46:15] <Grenwolth> the Slovenian Slut
[00:47:50] <Gruselbauer> hahaha yeah you really have followed michelle obama up ...
[00:48:03] <Gruselbauer> like a bad soap opera
[00:52:38] <Gruselbauer> is nobody else using chrome/chromium here and ever had to install an extension not officially supported?
[00:53:39] <Grenwolth> <-- firefox
[00:53:50] <Grenwolth> <- Windows
[00:53:52] <kkit> yes Gruselbauer, i think you can't anymore
[00:54:00] <Grenwolth> <- haha
[00:54:28] <kkit> there was a user setting for a while
[00:54:36] <kkit> it might be a command line switch now, if it's still supported
[00:54:42] <kkit> you miiiiiight have to build your own copy
[00:54:50] <Gruselbauer> that sucks a lot
[00:54:58] <Gruselbauer> k, so firefox for youtube now
[00:55:06] <Gruselbauer> since i am not building chrome no way
[00:55:27] <kkit> you can use greasemonkey still
[00:55:30] <kkit> or userscripts or whatever
[00:55:41] <Gruselbauer> yeah i wanna disable dash loading for youtube
[00:55:48] <Gruselbauer> but it is being a bit of a dick
[00:55:52] <Gruselbauer> it being chrome
[01:04:46] <Resinator> i use a addon called magic actions for youtube
[01:05:23] <Resinator> https://www.chromeactions.com/
[01:05:43] <Resinator> not sure what dash loading is but it's a nice little addon
[01:05:55] <Gruselbauer> if that can disable dash i wll use it
[01:06:05] <CthulhuChaos> lego batman was a lot of fun
[01:06:40] <CthulhuChaos> some pretty good bad guy guest appearances 
[01:06:54] <Resinator> hwat is 'dash'
[01:07:16] <Gruselbauer> dynamic adaptive streaming something html something
[01:07:33] <Gruselbauer> Random and slew say it's responsible for youtube beng a nightmare instead of just a bad dream
[01:07:51] <Resinator> interesting
[01:07:54] <Gruselbauer> in my case. the thing where it does not pre-buffer anymore for longer than a few seconds
[01:08:28] <Resinator> not sure about that but it has an option called 'speedbooster'
[01:08:40] <Resinator> which the only description is 'better video preloading / buffering'
[01:08:53] <azk> CthulhuChaos: nice
[01:09:03] <Resinator> and the only extra option is 'play sound on completion'
[01:09:27] <Resinator> i'd check it out, not sure about that feature but magic actions has changed my youtubing life
[01:10:13] <CthulhuChaos> azk, i saw a review or two saying it was the best batman since dark knight and it is kinda hard to argue that

[01:19:09] <Resinator> sucks
[01:19:17] <Resinator> was hoping it'd be that simple
[01:19:23] <Gruselbauer> yeah, generally my interwebs situation sucks a lot
[01:19:27] <Gruselbauer> so, no worries
[01:19:29] <Resinator> why
[01:20:22] <Resinator> i guess i have to go buy some dog food
[01:21:28] <Gruselbauer> or maybe it does work? let's see if the videos load entirely
[01:22:50] <Gruselbauer> ha it does!
[01:23:10] <Gruselbauer> Resinator: you win. thanks. awesome.
[01:24:11] <Resinator> also it gives u a light switch in the top left
[01:24:16] <Resinator> so u can turn youtube black
[01:24:23] <Gruselbauer> CthulhuChaos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1VMaNBOIFs you probably know this

[01:30:56] <slew> Gruselbauer: on firefox type about:config into the url bar and then search for a line called "media.mediasource.enabled"
[01:31:27] <slew> if you disable it, youtube will only allow 360/480/720p at 30fps but will buffer the entire video
[01:31:47] <slew> use ublock origin to stop ads loading entirely too for more speed

[13:29:54] <deadmind> uh-oh
[13:29:58] <alpaca> you should be interested
[13:30:00] <alpaca> they are pretty
[13:30:02] <deadmind> did you get your alpaca on?
[13:30:05] <alpaca> lol
[13:30:05] <deadmind> :o
[13:30:12] <alpaca> they are my best friends
[13:30:15] <deadmind> i'm feeling like there is some kind of catch coming
[13:30:19] <alpaca> there it was
[13:30:20] <alpaca> lol
[13:30:28] <alpaca> known them for like 15 years
[13:30:34] <deadmind> your best friends are all girls?
[13:30:37] <alpaca> nah
[13:30:41] <alpaca> but some of them are!
[13:30:58] <alpaca> actually, the two girls staying here right now
[13:30:58] <alpaca> and i
[13:31:01] <alpaca> all have the same tattoo
[13:31:01] <deadmind> that explains a lot 
[13:31:03] <deadmind> :D
[13:31:05] <alpaca> for a friend of ours that passed in 2010
[13:31:07] <slew> its a russet
[13:31:12] <alpaca> slew: god dammit
[13:31:15] <alpaca> literally worst potato
[13:31:23] <slew> is it? i'm not a potato expert
[13:31:27] <alpaca> yeah
[13:31:27] <slew> whats the best type
[13:31:34] <alpaca> idk i am partial to red skin and fingerling potats
[13:31:45] <slew> red skins taste weird though don't they
[13:31:49] <alpaca> eh idk
[13:31:55] <alpaca> they are great in mashed p's
[13:31:56] <slew> whats sweet potato
[13:32:03] <alpaca> delicious
[13:32:05] <alpaca> is what it is
[13:32:06] <deadmind> alpaca: can i come over though? :D
[13:32:10] <slew> no as in is it red skin 
[13:32:13] <alpaca> deadmind: illl allow it
[13:32:16] <alpaca> slew: nah
[13:32:27] <alpaca> skin just gives texture imo
[13:32:42] <alpaca> ,my taste buds are not the most accurate devices in the world though
[13:32:55] <slew> you gotta ask a dog what it thinks of potato
[13:33:25] <slew> ask it to rank them on a scale of bark to bark bark bark bark bark
[13:33:37] <alpaca> o slew you are so silly
[13:34:07] Action: deadmind gets on a plane with a bunch of aphrodisiacs, hot pants and backup dildos to visit alpaca and his harem
[13:34:21] <slew> i've devised a system in which the dog could accurately convey its feelings about potato and i'm called silly
[13:34:28] <slew> well we'll see who's laughing when it works
[13:35:40] <slew> heh i blazed through this anime without appreciating they released 2 episodes every 2 months

[15:37:58] <Gruselbauer> problem being i can only listen to them with quite some delay
[15:38:44] <Gruselbauer> so for the time being i have have to rely on my own records and i have lent the majority of my music collection to a friend in october and he's being a slow son of a bitch returning it
[15:39:08] <Gruselbauer> so instead of 3-4tb of mp3s and flacs, i have whatever torrents i can finish at night with zero hope of ever getting the pth ratio back 
[15:39:43] <Gruselbauer> though it gives me something to bitch about
[15:39:51] <zen> haha
[15:40:02] <zen> u are leet h4x0r

[15:44:27] <Gruselbauer> lol you overestimate my abilities by a ton
[15:44:57] <Gruselbauer> i mean, i hope seedbox services can't get pwned by some dude who starts kali and does what some manual tells him too?
[15:45:08] <zen> run makeseedbox.exe hehe
[15:45:39] <Gruselbauer> now i gotta install wine too? :(
[15:45:56] <zen> :D

[18:49:25] <alpaca> this is my equivalent
[18:49:43] <Gruselbauer> oorza: that is something we should track
[18:49:48] <alpaca> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89IxL0_4Ev8
[18:49:51] <Gruselbauer> like we need a last.fm for weed
[18:49:54] <oorza> i'm good for like 10lb life time
[18:50:10] <Gruselbauer> oorza: that's a ton but i am at least at 2kg
[18:50:19] <oorza> no a ton is 2000lb
[18:50:21] <Gruselbauer> so, not too much since i barely toked when i was on smack
[18:50:30] <oorza> we need to come up with 1990lb more if i count for 10
[18:50:34] <Gruselbauer> yeah, the literal ton at least
[18:50:41] <Gruselbauer> i count for 4 then
[18:50:44] <alpaca> ive smoked like 10-20 lbs maybe
[18:50:49] <oorza> where's entr0py 
[18:50:51] <alpaca> 30 max
[18:50:51] <oorza> he's the oldest toker
[18:50:57] <oorza> he's probably good for 50
[18:51:03] <alpaca> i smoke an ounce a month
[18:51:06] <Random> what about gren?
[18:51:08] <alpaca> and ive been smoking for a decade
[18:51:11] <alpaca> well, regularly
[18:51:19] <Gruselbauer> haha data + toking, good topic
[18:51:26] <alpaca> so, nearly 10 lbs
[18:51:34] <oorza> yeah i'm doing the math and thinking i smoke >2 oz a month is basically 2lb a year
[18:51:37] <oorza> i might be closer to 25 than 10
[18:51:53] <Gruselbauer> BOMBACLAAAD ...
[18:51:59] <Random> My estimate for lifetime consumption is about 2.5 lbs
[18:52:25] <Gruselbauer> i have a feeling my toking is about to go up by like a lot for the next months
[18:52:41] <Gruselbauer> but still feel like i will start growing again in a few weeks
[18:53:02] <Gruselbauer> i think 1-2lbs a year of my own shit would be a nice amount of weed to have

[19:53:28] <alpaca> nothing that huge can be cool
[19:53:37] <alpaca> like if you had a 24 inch penis

[19:56:39] <alpaca> wont lie
[19:57:00] <Gruselbauer> i can maybe not hax0r some chip level shit exactly to my insane liking but it lets me do anything i want pretty painlessly
[19:57:15] <Gruselbauer> yeah the retina screen is a revelation
[19:57:21] <Gruselbauer> 3K on 13" is soooo nice
[19:59:16] <Gruselbauer> also yeah 24" dick would be crazy
[19:59:21] <Gruselbauer> like "look at my huge wiener"
[19:59:28] <Gruselbauer> but nobody could do anything more
[19:59:38] <Gruselbauer> you'd have to fuck like large animals

[20:02:42] <Gruselbauer> not asking me on several levels, would be interested but you don't optimize for 1000ms lag i am sure :D
[20:02:52] <carefish> actually i do
[20:02:57] <carefish> that's the thing i wanna practice
[20:03:08] <carefish> how to pack my bits and bytes in a neat, succinct order
[20:03:43] <Gruselbauer> yeah but won't it hurt your metric if you factor in something that is so rare nowadays?
[20:03:52] <carefish> nope
[20:03:56] <carefish> it would reduce latency
[20:04:00] <carefish> and open up more options gameplay wise
[20:04:08] <carefish> or stuff i want to sync authoritavely
[20:04:21] <carefish> reduce latency by reducing throughput *
[20:04:45] <Gruselbauer> okay dokey, then if i can play it on an i5 with an intel graphics card on macos, i totally will try to
[20:04:46] <carefish> ie: 1 packet of a few bytes is better than a bunch of packets w/ their own byte
