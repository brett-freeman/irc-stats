[01:04:50] <slew> let's get high on TabulaRasa
[01:05:15] <slew> who's Wesley
[01:05:27] <slew> are you cheating on me
[01:05:41] <StolenToast> slew: do you want tsr2 fax?
[01:05:47] <StolenToast> do you know what the tsr2 is?
[01:05:53] <slew> no
[01:06:05] <StolenToast> I should not have asked two questions at once
[01:06:11] <slew> yes
[01:06:29] <StolenToast> anyway the tsr2 was ol' england's shot at a hypersonic fighterjet
[01:06:40] <StolenToast> but they were TOO BRITISH about it
[01:06:56] <slew> old England is better than the New England
[01:06:56] <StolenToast> got caught up in the details and the project was eventually canned
[01:07:21] <slew> you know about the Vulcan right
[01:07:29] <StolenToast> it was a cool plane, just not very feasible
[01:08:00] <StolenToast> I know of it
[01:08:26] <slew> they recently had the last flight, was sad to see it finish
[01:12:30] <slew> the expanse's need to pretend like mag boots sufficiently hand wave zero gravity scenes is annoying to me
[01:12:59] <slew> it doesn't explain away why their hair doesn't float and shit they chuck at tables doesn't bounce off and fly away
[01:13:08] <KillerBong> *microgravity
[01:13:31] <slew> it's zero if they're flying between asteroids tho
[01:13:38] <KillerBong> no
[01:13:44] <KillerBong> its near zero
[01:13:50] <KillerBong> but gravity never dropps off to zero
[01:13:59] <KillerBong> all matter in universe is still acting on you
[01:14:26] <KillerBong> like ur still in galactic orbit
[01:14:42] <KillerBong> still trapped in local galaxy goup
[01:14:48] <KillerBong> ist never zero
[01:14:52] <slew> I was going to say you're being pedantic but I did start out whining about a tv show
[01:14:58] <KillerBong> haha
[01:16:09] <slew> in microgravity objects tend to behave like in zero gravity though
[01:16:26] <slew> something about non inertial reference frames
[01:16:37] <slew> or some shit idk
[01:16:48] <KillerBong> on human timescales yeah
[01:17:14] jeffsmith (~js@in.the.clouds) left irc: Input/output error
[01:17:53] <slew> I know it's probably not in their budget but it'd be cool to see them failing to catch stuff because the "gravity" is wrong
[01:18:02] jeffsmith (~js@in.the.clouds) joined #420.
[01:19:02] <slew> you'd need to be able to intuit how hard you're accelerating to be able to handle that automatically, right?
[01:20:08] <KillerBong> well
[01:20:16] <KillerBong> lower gravity gives you more time tho
[01:22:11] <slew> but you read the books they seem to use a RNG to pick how hard they accelerate that day
[01:26:27] <slew> sports set in space would be great to watch too, imagine zero g space tennis
[01:26:54] <slew> it'd be pong but irl
[01:31:40] <KillerBong> it would be really silly to see heavy weight lifters struggle to pick up a bar of iron, just a bar.
[01:45:49] <carefish> eheh
[01:45:59] <carefish> speaking of space 
[01:46:07] <carefish> does anyone of you own any space-themed game?
[01:46:17] <KillerBong> i own many
[01:46:18] <carefish> i know slew does ksp stuff
[01:46:33] <KillerBong> dead space series is good
[01:46:40] <KillerBong> homeworld is really good
[01:46:42] <carefish> and multipalyer?
[01:47:01] <[_]> only FTL here
[01:47:10] <KillerBong> ftl? still?
[01:47:17] <KillerBong> how many hours do you have
[01:47:23] <[_]> dunno
[01:47:27] <KillerBong> check steam
[01:47:40] <[_]> no steam, i got it in humblebundle
[01:47:45] <KillerBong> oh okay
[01:48:52] <carefish> then you could/still can(?) get a steam copy
[01:49:40] <[_]> oh that is likely
[01:49:43] <[_]> it was included
[01:50:04] <KillerBong> ranked has started in wows again
[01:50:04] <[_]> 32 and 64bit .tgz as well :D
[01:50:08] <KillerBong> 1 or bust.
[01:51:50] <carefish> you can still log in on humble bundle and check if you can redeem it on steam [_] 
[01:52:10] <[_]> yeah, but i have no other steam games, or an account :D
[01:52:42] <[_]> heh
[01:52:52] <[_]> i'm just not really a 'hip gamer'
[01:53:04] <[_]> i play more nethack/dungeon crawl than anything else
[01:53:38] <carefish> time to become 'hip' and 'cool'
[01:55:01] <KillerBong> you mean you have a potatocomputer
[01:55:35] <KillerBong> carefish: being a programer
[01:55:41] <KillerBong> can you pls buy spacebase
[01:55:44] <KillerBong> and compleate it
[01:55:48] <carefish> spacebase?
[01:55:50] <KillerBong> because i loooved it
[01:56:09] <carefish> double fine are asshats
[01:56:12] <carefish> well
[01:56:13] <KillerBong> yes
[01:56:17] <carefish> sort-a.
[01:56:17] <KillerBong> fucking assholes
[01:56:24] <carefish> i doubt i can get their ip
[01:56:29] <carefish> i can give it a whirl tho
[01:56:34] <KillerBong> hehe
[01:56:37] <KillerBong> there are some mods
[01:56:44] <KillerBong> they dont fix the game
[01:56:57] <[_]> i used to be with it, but then they changed what it was.  now what i'm with isn't it and what's it seems weird and scary to me. -- Abraham Lincoln, Wabbit Hunter.
[01:58:05] <carefish> apparently there are efforts to bugfix and stuff tho KillerBong ?
[01:58:24] <KillerBong> i donno i havent checked in like a year
[01:58:49] <KillerBong> i dont really know how to discibe what that game was
[01:59:00] <carefish> i didn't play it
[01:59:08] <KillerBong> sim space base without any instabuild
[01:59:16] <KillerBong> you needed to have the crew do everything
[01:59:30] <KillerBong> and you needed to keep them happy and fed and entertained to make it work
[02:00:19] <carefish> oh damn
[02:00:39] <KillerBong> i guess strategy games are kind of like that, you need things to do things  for you but they always have perfect moral and perfect cooperation
[02:00:42] <[_]> KillerBong, maybe it is a potato
[02:01:02] <KillerBong> put two ppl that hate each other in the same room in that game and they might start fighting
[02:01:08] <KillerBong> and then someone had to go to the brig 
[02:01:33] <KillerBong> they designed it as a failsimulator
[02:01:48] <KillerBong> any death demoralizes everyone super much and makes them work slower
[02:02:08] <KillerBong> loose two ppl and everyone will moap for a week and not work and fix the o2 recyclers and shit
[02:02:09] <carefish> hmmhm
[02:02:13] <KillerBong> spiral into everyone dying
[02:02:18] <carefish> lmao
[02:02:24] <[_]> KillerBong, https://hastebin.com/xakoriseje.sql
[02:02:33] <carefish> have you played 'don't starve together'?
[02:02:47] <KillerBong> no, i dont like third person games with only one avatar
[02:02:54] <KillerBong> looks cute tho
[02:03:06] <carefish> hehe
[02:03:15] <carefish> it's frustrating at times
[02:03:18] <carefish> but similar
[02:03:38] <carefish> only this time... you need to keep yourself and your friends sane and well fed
[02:03:50] <carefish> make a fuckup, spiral into death

[06:10:11] <azk> Which is FreeBSD with actual exploit mitigation
[06:10:18] <azk> and OpenBSD for router
[06:10:27] <azk> Because fuck freebsd PF
[06:10:36] <azk> And I just really like OpenBSD
[06:12:20] <Random> I've toyed with free/net/openbsd, but nothing has stuck
[06:12:35] <azk> Idk
[06:12:45] <azk> I like freebsd for zfs tbh
[06:12:57] <Random> which is pretty awesome in linux now
[06:12:59] <azk> and some other neat features
[06:13:01] <azk> True
[06:13:07] <azk> but always outside of distribution
[06:13:07] <Random> I'm using it all over the place
[06:13:10] <azk> because of licensing
[06:13:19] <Random> but yeah smartos is what got me really hooked on the idea
[06:13:22] <azk> ZoL has been growing stronger
[06:13:24] <Random> no not outside of distro anymore
[06:13:36] <azk> Wait what, they can distribute zfs now?
[06:13:40] <Random> and also in the kernel not FUSE anymore
[06:13:45] <azk> shit
[06:13:47] <azk> niiiiice
[06:13:56] <azk> been a while since I checked it out
[06:14:00] <Random> only some distros, its compiled as a module
[06:14:04] <azk> Right
[06:14:09] <Random> but even centos, you can add a repo, and boom
[06:14:14] <azk> Well yeah
[06:14:20] <azk> I mean you can do that in most distros
[06:14:24] <azk> But like
[06:14:36] <Random> yeah.  but ubuntu its in the defaults now
[06:14:37] <azk> being able to set up a system with it natively is ideal
[06:14:39] <ZZdawg> and this is why not to use win 10
[06:14:50] <azk> Random: that's crazy
[06:14:52] <azk> I love it
[06:14:59] <azk> btrfs BTFO
[06:15:11] <Random> especially after their "oops, dont use our raid afterall"
[06:15:40] <Random> but yeah, zfs ftw
[06:15:52] <Random> love the snapshots, and how easy it is to send snapshots to other servers
[06:15:57] <Random> zrep et al
[06:16:13] <azk> Yeah
[06:16:20] <azk> Everything about zfs is sexy
[06:16:40] <Random> and with ECC ram, I feel pretty happy about data stability
[06:16:42] <azk> except how you can't really grow pools organically
[06:16:46] <Random> too bad so few of my ''servers'' have that
[06:16:53] <Random> but still, checksumming is nice either way
[06:16:54] <azk> True
[06:17:07] <azk> Even without ECC it's still fantastic in my experience
[06:17:09] <azk> but yeah
[06:17:13] <Random> yeah, it's slightly at a disadvantage to linux md arrays in that sense
[06:17:23] <Random> but ive lost md arrays during grows, so im not that hooked on the concept
[06:17:35] <azk> FreeBSD's zfs is the best implementation outside of joyent
[06:17:55] <azk> I know that feeling.
[06:18:15] <azk> It's just a thing which I wish would be a thing in zfs
[06:18:36] <azk> But yeah
[06:18:44] <azk> OpenBSD has it's allures as well
[06:18:47] <azk> PF for one
[06:18:50] <azk> is so fucking good
[06:19:06] <azk> Pledge is another 
[06:19:18] <Random> http://zfsonlinux.org/ is pretty stable these days.. but yeah, that's what got me so interested in illumos and eventually openidiana which is a surprisingly competent desktop
[06:19:24] <azk> And that the whole os is w^x now
[06:19:44] <azk> pledge plus w^x
[06:19:48] <azk> so fucking good
[06:20:05] <ZZdawg> dev's at work...
[06:20:31] <azk> Devs a shit
[06:20:41] <azk> They never know anything about their system.
[06:20:45] <Random> yeah I played with pax and grsecurity patches on gentoo a bit
[06:20:55] <azk> Yeah
[06:21:03] <azk> grsec is a valiant attempt
[06:21:22] <azk> but it doesn't come close to the elegance that theo and friends have created.
[06:21:27] <azk> it's fucking beautiful.
[06:21:35] <[_]> coldhak.ca  <-- some skullspace members working on secure kernel stuff
[06:21:37] <Random> yeah, linux is encumbered with a lot that makes it hard to fully execute those concepts. heh
[06:21:53] <azk> Yeah.
[06:22:04] <azk> You could definitely do a distro that did that
[06:22:14] <azk> but it'd have to be unified like a BSD tbh
[06:22:21] <Random> oh nice boxman.  I might poke that

[06:52:10] <oorza> are you into dance like azk 
[06:52:13] <oorza> have you watched The OA
[06:52:23] <oorza> it's a  sci fi show about magical dancing

[08:47:18] <azk> :D

[08:48:34] <embri0n> will def check the rest 
[08:49:19] <azk> Yeah

[13:51:54] <carefish> neat KillerBong. i hope the 550w psu will hold it all
[13:55:22] <KillerBong> i love he bought a little ups and included it in his upgrade pic
[13:55:57] <KillerBong> its kind of weird that for many there is a year of food there
[13:56:13] <KillerBong> and we only use it to game tentacle porn games

[13:56:45] <deadmind> :/
[13:57:11] <carefish> well
[13:57:14] <carefish> i watched it last night
[13:57:16] <carefish> was fun
[13:57:23] <deadmind> indeed
[13:57:26] <KillerBong> it?
[13:57:30] <carefish> the expanse
[13:57:31] <deadmind> it's still doing it
[13:57:32] <carefish> ep1-2-3
[13:57:34] <deadmind> :D
[13:57:36] <KillerBong> ah
[13:57:53] <KillerBong> http://i.imgur.com/x8l7Nf6.jpg
[13:58:04] <deadmind> i figured after the immense replayability and immersiveness of season 1 it's bound to take a turn for the worse
[13:58:14] <deadmind> but after the first 3 eps... no, it's still doing it.

[14:16:30] <KillerBong> lol half of it is gone already

[14:23:02] <KillerBong> haha
[14:23:09] <KillerBong> nice reaching
[14:29:09] <KillerBong> https://i.redd.it/zumvyv7dt4fy.jpg - this is a painting made will ballpoint pens.
[14:29:13] <KillerBong> thats pretty fucking good
[14:38:26] <kkit> ironic given that it's been cnn and other moderate and left-leaning news orgs that were spreading the term fake news
[14:38:39] <kkit> when in fact, the right term would just be "propaganda" or "lies"
[14:40:21] <kkit> KillerBong, if you like wyoming wind gifs, you'll like http://www.wmta.us/wind.htm
[14:45:05] <KillerBong> kkit: yes, propaganda is a very good term
[14:45:28] <kkit> like when you see right-wingers post articles from RT or sputnik
[14:45:42] <kkit> "guys russian journalism is toooooooottally unbiased just like breitbart"
[14:46:12] <kkit> though i think journalism would be a generous term, given that we're talking about russian government media arms
[14:46:43] <KillerBong> lol
[14:46:55] <KillerBong> its always spun 
[14:47:04] <KillerBong> all information is always spun somehow
[14:47:19] <kkit> yeah but i prefer my news to be spun from someone who isn't definitely the opposition
[14:47:40] <kkit> it would be like trusting stormfront for news about black people
[14:47:43] <kkit> and jwes
[14:48:16] <KillerBong> i would like it not to be spun at all
[14:48:31] <kkit> do you think "no spin" exists anywhere?
[14:48:36] <KillerBong> but since that all we have i´d rather not read it at all and stay uninformed
[14:48:38] <kkit> aside from the bill o'reilly show ofc
[14:48:41] <kkit> that's the no spin zone
[14:48:52] <KillerBong> no, since that would confilct with my earlyer statements of everything being spun
[14:49:18] <KillerBong> or no
[14:49:20] <KillerBong> i take that back
[14:49:34] <kkit> so you're saying you'd rather be clueless than have an inkling about issues that may affect you?
[14:49:37] <KillerBong> i would rather someoneone like bill burr put a comedic and cynic spin on it
[14:49:47] <kkit> oh so you want to get your news from the daily show
[14:49:59] <KillerBong> kkit: i would not be informed from reading spun info, i would be missinformed
[14:50:19] <kkit> so are you completely ignorant of history before your own memory?
[14:50:28] <KillerBong> so either i read everything, preferebly source material, that is also always spun
[14:50:43] <KillerBong> or i would want a cynical perspective
[14:50:44] <Grenwolth> His memory only goes bacvk to yesterday
[14:50:55] <kkit> does that mean you won't read science books because the data is spun into a narrative?
[14:51:00] <KillerBong> wow
[14:51:09] <KillerBong> ur really taking it litteraly
[14:51:13] <kkit> i'm just wondering where your definition of spin goes
[14:51:19] <KillerBong> i said it before
[14:51:26] <KillerBong> all information is always spun somehow
[14:51:34] <KillerBong> only thing thats not is raw data
[14:51:49] <kkit> hahahahaha
[14:51:50] <kkit> ahahahaha
[14:51:52] <kkit> oh boy
[14:52:01] <KillerBong> yeah ohh no you cought me
[14:52:03] <kkit> you're in trouble dude if you think raw data isn't or can't be spun
[14:52:14] <KillerBong> i never said that
[14:52:18] <zen> so you can't angle raw data?
[14:52:21] <kkit> what do you mean
[14:52:24] <kkit> you just did
[14:52:26] <zen> you just did lol
[14:52:27] <zen> ...
[14:52:27] <slew> ....
[14:52:28] <KillerBong> i was just typing out "but i cant even get that"
[14:52:28] <kkit> 18<22KillerBong18> only thing thats not is raw data
[14:52:42] <KillerBong> "because they dont even include all the data in datasets"
[14:52:46] <kkit> yeah but i'm saying this statement is also incorrect on its face
[14:52:50] <KillerBong> but pls, go on and prove me a sheep kkit 
[14:53:01] <kkit> you can collect misleading data rather easily if you use flawed methodology
[14:53:02] <KillerBong> since thats obviously your goal regardless what i say here
[14:53:04] <zen> we are gonna need some sources to these claims KillerBong
[14:53:29] <kkit> no, i'm trying to point out that trashing everythign as spin leads you down a silly rabbit hole
[14:53:49] <kkit> and having raw data isn't very useful if you don't know how to re-analyze it yourself
[14:53:50] <KillerBong> right
[14:53:55] Action: zen fingers kkits rabbit hole
[14:53:56] <deadmind> be careful guys
[14:53:58] <KillerBong> oh
[14:54:02] <KillerBong> i was just typing that out too
[14:54:10] <deadmind> he's going to label all of #420 obvious trolls and ignore everyone
[14:54:12] Action: zen let's deadmind get in on the action
[14:54:20] <kkit> it isn't irc if people aren't being pedantic
[14:54:24] <KillerBong> but whatever, im a sheep
[14:54:29] <KillerBong> ignorant also
[14:54:35] <kkit> you'll note that i haven't called you a sheep or ignorant
[14:54:36] <zen> quote!
[14:54:37] <zen> lol
[14:54:39] <KillerBong> btw i hate women and dont want them to have abortions
[14:54:42] <KillerBong> for ANY reason
[14:55:01] <KillerBong> is there anything else you wanted kkit?
[14:55:03] <deadmind> not even for revenge?
[14:55:08] <kkit> it's also very easy to use numbers to lie, which is why numeric literacy is so important
[14:55:13] <kkit> you can read beyond the spin
[14:55:24] <KillerBong> i also said this a wile ago
[14:55:26] <kkit> stop being shitty KillerBong 
[14:55:32] <KillerBong> stop accusing me
[14:55:46] <KillerBong> stop trying to prove everything i say WRONG
[14:55:56] <KillerBong> because yeah ur right, i dont know EVERYTHING
[14:56:52] <kkit> i know, because you said you prefer staying uninformed :)
[14:57:12] <KillerBong> yeah because that was a totally accurate statement
[14:57:27] <KillerBong> not at all just a sentiment showing my frustration
[14:57:43] <KillerBong> its good that we now established that
[14:57:46] <KillerBong> thanks kkit 
[14:57:58] <zen> lol
[14:58:03] <kkit> i can only read things in the context in which you say them
[14:58:03] <deadmind> you're trying to force your bad knowledge on him kkit, so he must resist
[14:58:08] <zen> u gotta be the prudest swede i know
[14:58:20] <deadmind> he is only a conduit and teacher of Good Knowledge
[14:58:51] <deadmind> and good knowledge comes to you as divine inspiration and the Internet, never from other people :D
[14:59:19] <zen> haha deadmind ^5
[14:59:58] <slew> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ad4CXCTNTc
[15:02:25] <Ze_Knakkers> <- toast with blue cheese and an apple for brunch
[15:02:36] <slew> blue cheese? well la-dee-daa
[15:02:50] <Ze_Knakkers> mister fancypants commencypants
[15:02:59] <slew> over here we make do with cheddar
[15:03:15] <Ze_Knakkers> good cheddar is a fucking orgasm
[15:03:19] <Ze_Knakkers> like, properly aged and stuff
[15:03:23] <slew> yes
[15:03:28] <Ze_Knakkers> the kind that falls apart when you touch it
[15:03:31] <slew> unfortunately most of the stuff isn't good
[15:03:32] <carefish> cheese knobs
[15:03:34] <deadmind> yes
[15:03:38] <Ze_Knakkers> and that's neither cheaper nor worse than the blue cheese i have atm
[15:03:42] <deadmind> it gets your hands all sticky and makes you feel all ashamed
[15:04:01] <Ze_Knakkers> you think all krauts eat good cheese? we have cheese that is made without milk in supermarkets, too
[15:04:45] <Ze_Knakkers> hell 90% of krauts eat worse than americans probably but still wank each other off on being juropeen' ubermenschens
[15:05:22] <deadmind> that'll stop once you all start getting fat
[15:05:26] <slew> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg8guNLNjeY
[15:05:26] <deadmind> :D
[15:05:34] <kkit> what's the smoking rate in europe
[15:05:39] <kkit> last time i was there everyone still smoked
[15:05:55] <slew> a lot of the chicks i see when i go to the mainland are pretty smoking
[15:06:13] <Ze_Knakkers> god yes, italy or france man
[15:06:17] <Ze_Knakkers> or deadmindcountry
[15:06:54] <Ze_Knakkers> also kkit i have no idea, but judging by how it seems to die with you guys probably higher
[15:07:47] <kkit> deadmind, the uk already caught up to america
[15:08:53] <deadmind> yeah and i think my country is alarmingly fat as well
[15:08:59] <Ze_Knakkers> regrding fatlery?
[15:09:15] <Ze_Knakkers> hitler will make everyone fitler
[15:09:18] <deadmind> i don't see many fat people, but the statistics say we're like the fattest in the eu
[15:09:27] <deadmind> maybe here fat people just don'"t think it's okay :D
[15:09:37] <deadmind> or they all get substandard care and can't move, like my mom
[15:09:45] <zen> lol
[15:09:59] <zen> aren't germans fatter then you guys?
[15:09:59] <Ze_Knakkers> or they are being eaten because that is what it's like
[15:10:04] <Ze_Knakkers> probably
[15:10:10] <zen> paprika seams better then bratwurst
[15:10:10] <Ze_Knakkers> i sure am fatter than deadmind
[15:10:18] <deadmind> :D
[15:10:19] <zen> everybody is Ze_Knakkers 
[15:10:22] <deadmind> i am a poor example
[15:10:27] <zen> deadmind: is a walking skeleton giant
[15:10:29] <Ze_Knakkers> ZERE IZ NOZING BETTER ZAN BRATWURZT
[15:10:35] <deadmind> the average skinny person's bones are fatter than deadmind

[15:10:55] <downboy> 196cm tall, 84kg weight
[15:10:56] <zen> i like a skinny ass fuck
[15:11:07] <deadmind> lol downboy
[15:11:08] <slew> ass fuck
[15:11:10] <deadmind> that's almost healthy
[15:11:20] <deadmind> i've never been 80kg :D
[15:11:23] <Ze_Knakkers> downboy: crazy. I weight more at 190
[15:11:24] <downboy> well, i dont complain on my health really
[15:11:26] <zen> but big booties need love too
[15:11:32] <downboy> cant remember when i went to see a doctor
[15:11:36] <Ze_Knakkers> like, i'm around 105 at 187
[15:11:45] <deadmind> i'm going to see one today :D
[15:11:53] <deadmind> damn Ze_Knakkers, you fatass
[15:11:57] <Ze_Knakkers> too much but i can live with it and i am pretty broad shouldered
[15:11:59] <downboy> i should be around 90 for perfect weight
[15:12:03] <deadmind> that's like 1/6th of half a car
[15:12:06] <deadmind> :D
[15:12:07] <lizarwizarblizzard> the fastest way to loose weight is amputation
[15:12:09] <downboy> but still in good level they say
[15:12:09] <zen> be careful deadmind there is sunshine outside
[15:12:12] <lizarwizarblizzard> deadmind attempted it
[15:12:12] <zen> you might melt
[15:12:15] <zen> ./turn to dust
[15:12:19] <deadmind> :D
[15:12:38] <deadmind> i think yall are fishing for canned insults
[15:12:40] <downboy> cant decide what to game today :/
[15:12:41] <lizarwizarblizzard> although he is barely visible when he is sideways
[15:12:51] <deadmind> downboy: skyrim fo sho
[15:12:52] <downboy> didnt turn on ps4 for days
[15:12:58] <zen> talking bout ur hand now dm?
[15:12:58] <lizarwizarblizzard> skyrim!!
[15:13:01] <downboy> dont have skyrim just yet
[15:13:29] <zen> lol lizarwizarblizzard
[15:13:30] <lizarwizarblizzard> downboy: what do you have?
[15:13:47] <zen> watch out he might slip down the cracks in the floorboards
[15:13:49] <downboy> about 40 games so far
[15:13:50] <Ze_Knakkers> have not had on ps4 for days but currently too broke for new games 
[15:14:12] <downboy> i found a way to buy new games
[15:14:23] <downboy> top up ps account with mobile phone
[15:14:26] <Ze_Knakkers> probs gonna get no man's sky soon
[15:14:34] <downboy> buy a game, then pay fucking mobile bill or they will turn it off :D
[15:14:45] <downboy> so every damn month got like 130 pounds mobile bill
[15:14:46] <Ze_Knakkers> lol
[15:15:01] <downboy> but at least my game collection is growing
[15:15:11] <Ze_Knakkers> i can just buy shit directly onto where i get my wage to, so that seems like a lot of hassle
[15:15:16] <Ze_Knakkers> + i cannot download games
[15:15:28] <downboy> yeah, i preffer digital purchases
[15:15:41] <downboy> every damn time i buy a game on disc, i will sell it before even finished
[15:16:09] <downboy> plus, sony went crazy last 2 months with discounts
[15:16:34] <downboy> best purchase was 5 games worth 130 quid for 32
[15:17:43] <downboy> im oldish fucker but buying those games cos im buying another ps4 for my brother, so he has some choices ithout spending money
[15:17:51] <slew> because they're starting to see their customers wake up and see how pc is better
[15:18:14] <downboy> slew, i come from pc gaming generation but i love ps4
[15:18:15] <slew> after the upfront cost of the hardware and time setting it up it works out cheaper
[15:18:29] <slew> paying for online is a hilarious thing to me
[15:18:41] <downboy> well, you pay for ps plus
[15:19:01] <downboy> you get 2 games for ps4 for free every month, 2 games for ps3 if you have one and 2 games for ps vits
[15:19:05] <slew> do you get online multiplayer without ps plus
[15:19:09] <downboy> tell me its not worth this funny few quid
[15:19:21] <downboy> nah you dont
[15:19:27] <downboy> at least not on all games i think
[15:19:29] <slew> doesn't seem like a good deal to me then
[15:19:43] <downboy> i dont see why not
[15:19:56] <slew> you're making a barrier to entry for multiplayer when multiplayer benefits from more people
[15:20:01] <downboy> ok, you have to pay to play online but while paying you get more than you paid really
[15:20:19] <slew> but its not the other shit i'm interested in
[15:20:39] <downboy> i know what you mean but i still think it isnt as bad as it seems
[15:21:06] <slew> i see your point about the "free" stuff that you're actually paying for, but if you don't want that
[15:21:17] <slew> then you're basically paying for the ability to play with your friends
[15:21:46] <slew> there's probably an identical example on pc but i still don't see how its a good deal for me
[15:22:09] <downboy> firstly, its 40 quid a year
[15:22:15] <downboy> i spend more on weed in a week
[15:22:43] <downboy> during that time you get 24 games on ps4 and 24 games on ps3
[15:22:52] <downboy> as i have both, it is pretty sweet deal
[15:23:24] <downboy> over 300 games library on ps3 thanks to ps plus mainly
[15:23:33] <downboy> didnt buy that many games on ps3 really
[15:23:43] <downboy> mainly was renting at blockbuster while it existed
[15:24:45] <downboy> gotta admit, im used to pay for ps plus and i knew i will pay it anyway on ps4
[15:24:50] <downboy> so for me no difference
[15:36:09] <StolenToast> The new nintendo console has an online subscription
[15:36:25] <StolenToast> I think it's like $30 for a year, that's not bad
[15:36:54] <StolenToast> Nintendo has always been "the one with free online", and also "the one with the insufferably shitty online"
[15:37:13] <downboy> gotta give them a medal for trying though :d
[15:37:27] <StolenToast> The last TWO smash games have had online modes but no one really plays them seriously, the lag is too bad
[15:37:35] <downboy> if only they made wii more powerful
[15:37:59] <downboy> great idea at the time but games looked shit
[15:38:07] <StolenToast> I think their new sub online model will result in a far improved experience
[15:38:20] <StolenToast> Man the Wii had some fantastic looking games
[15:38:26] <StolenToast> Like Mario Galaxy
[15:38:31] <downboy> maybe once i stopped playing
[15:38:32] <StolenToast> Genuinely really good graphics
[15:38:39] <downboy> cos the beginning sucked
[15:38:46] <downboy> maybe few i dont even remember titles even
[15:38:54] <StolenToast> Nintendo's first party games usually looked really good
[15:39:01] <StolenToast> I had a wii
[15:39:04] <StolenToast> I have one now
[15:39:05] <downboy> same
[15:39:10] <downboy> we played it on 110" screen
[15:39:22] <downboy> 720p projector
[15:39:38] <downboy> dont get me wrong
[15:39:42] <downboy> was great fun
[15:39:50] <downboy> we really were gaming it like mad for few months
[15:39:58] <downboy> then it was somewhere on the wardrobe
[15:40:02] <downboy> ps3 in da house
[15:40:05] <StolenToast> Nintendo was good at making art for its power level
[15:40:19] <StolenToast> Other console games would often try to do something the console couldn't handle
[15:40:34] <StolenToast> That's when the 60fps wars started last generation
[15:40:46] <StolenToast> Nintendo never had frame dropping problems
[15:40:53] <carefish> ugh
[15:40:57] <StolenToast> The graphics were humble and scaled properly
[15:40:59] <carefish> gotta clean out my desktop from dust
[15:41:03] <downboy> cos games werent that resources hungry
[15:41:05] <carefish> not looking forward to that :<
[15:41:20] <StolenToast> No the games were fun at their core with graphics added
[15:41:44] <downboy> well, what i see on ps4 makes me very happy
[15:42:00] zso (~Shock@P2PNET-DDF9C299.ttnk.hu) joined #420.
[15:42:06] <downboy> i come from the world where snake game on mobile was considered state of an art
[15:42:31] <StolenToast> If I'm gonna get a console it'll be a switch, cuz most of the games for ps4 and Bone are for PC too
[15:42:46] <StolenToast> Man I was around when mobile phone snake was revolutionary
[15:42:55] <StolenToast> I just had no video games at the time
[15:43:00] <downboy> thats the thing, most, the exclusives, thats where its at :)
[15:43:22] <carefish> quite a lot of exclusives have failed tho
[15:43:24] <downboy> uncharted 4 was so good, i finished it in like a month
[15:43:29] <downboy> for me a record for a game
[15:43:30] <carefish> and the ones who stood the test of time are franchises now
[15:43:36] <StolenToast> The switch has the most exclusives that I specifically want, and AND hen the PC had a retardedly huge library at this point
[15:43:45] <StolenToast> *and then
[15:44:05] <downboy> well, gaming argues are stupid
[15:44:13] <downboy> each platform offers good experience
[15:44:22] <downboy> its a choice which one you go with, nothing else
[15:44:53] <downboy> who says if switch isnt good, i cant buy it
[15:44:59] <downboy> hell, already thinking about xbone
[15:45:04] <downboy> for its exclusives mainly
[15:45:58] <downboy> i wont mind having all good consoles and enjoy the good games :)
[15:46:56] <downboy> for now, got a mission, 100 games for ps4 by the end of 2017
[15:47:34] <downboy> close to 40 or over already after almost 4 months
[15:48:53] <downboy> watch dogs 2 discounted to 29.99
[15:48:58] <slew> i didn't realise it was £40 a year
[15:48:59] <downboy> maybe i should get it
[15:49:10] <downboy> yep, its 40 a year
[15:49:10] <slew> i thought it was something like £5/mo
[15:49:16] <downboy> so kinda not much
[15:49:24] <downboy> well, it is 5.99 a month
[15:49:26] <slew> are the free games even good
[15:49:26] <downboy> but 40 a year
[15:49:43] <downboy> well, it does depend
[15:49:51] <downboy> ps3 tends to have better free bies so far
[15:50:04] <slew> cause you could get some sweet old games for 40 a year on gog or steam
[15:50:11] <downboy> but you get nice discounts on games and sometimes good ps4 game
[15:50:30] <Ze_Knakkers> holy fuck it's not even four and i am _baked_
[15:50:30] <downboy> well, im only 4 months on ps4
[15:50:39] <downboy> just before me there was few AAA games
[15:50:55] Nick change: Ze_Knakkers -> Gruselbauer
[15:50:59] <downboy> so far so so  games for me but others seem to like 
[15:51:28] <downboy> but i like discounts on games for ps plus memebers
[15:52:49] <downboy> like i said, i have ps4 and my bro has ps3 with my user on it as main user
[15:53:19] <downboy> so he gets all games on it for free as ps plus memeber and as ps3 and ps4 platform is seperate, he can use my user on ps3 no probs

[15:58:47] <slew> man i wish i could have some deep fried food right now
[15:58:54] <Gruselbauer> chiseled, spotwelded and particle-accelerated
[15:58:54] <slew> instead all i got is this potato
[15:59:00] <Gruselbauer> 1 potato?
[15:59:05] <slew> 5 potato
[15:59:17] <Gruselbauer> "potatos" would be correct in that case
[15:59:24] <slew> yes probably
[15:59:32] <Gruselbauer> still, i will let it slide
[15:59:34] <slew> my head hurts too much from the cold
[15:59:37] <Gruselbauer> saturday is not a school day
[15:59:46] <slew> had to sit in the shower for 20 minutes just now
[16:00:06] <Gruselbauer> or is it a school day in the empire?
[16:00:15] <slew> who goes to school on a saturday
[16:00:20] <slew> that sounds like some asian thing
[16:00:40] <Gruselbauer> frenchies?
[16:00:42] <Gruselbauer> afair
[16:00:45] <slew> do they?
[16:00:52] <slew> frenchies also can't score 100% iirc
[16:00:55] <Gruselbauer> pretty sure they at least used to
[16:06:42] <Gruselbauer> you are autisting your way through the "french school system" wikipedia, right?
[16:07:30] <Gruselbauer> i am pretty sure i heard about saturday school in one of the two languages i learned in school, so it must've been about the anglosphere or france
[16:07:46] <Gruselbauer> (they completely ignore any french outside of france in our schools, yes)
[16:07:59] <Gruselbauer> le baguette s'il vouz plait

[16:11:10] <Gruselbauer> OH SHIT I AM DED
[16:11:22] <Grenwolth> I would like to see a b unch of Downs Syndrme kids holding up signs saying Act like  President
[16:12:08] <downboy> i had down syndrome neighbour
[16:12:27] <downboy> he was a day older than me but when i was 19 he was like 9
[16:13:04] <downboy> still was my buddy though, i liked him. not like he was tupid, he was bright just very fucking slow with it
[16:14:08] <downboy> heh
[16:14:38] <downboy> i was one of those people, who took care of him when others tried to make him stupid things outdoors
[16:14:50] <downboy> poor fella
[16:14:59] <downboy> that said
[16:15:03] <downboy> fucker was very strong
[16:15:40] <downboy> like because his brain was a bit slow, didnt realise how strong he suppose to be
[16:15:56] <Gruselbauer> yeah picking on weaker kids is shitty
[16:16:15] <Gruselbauer> generally picking fights you cannot lose is for really weak people
[16:16:18] <downboy> indeed
[16:16:32] <downboy> not weak
[16:16:37] <downboy> mentally challenged :D
[16:17:13] <downboy> give them some hoffman tab, they will sit in a corner and cry most likely
[16:17:13] <carefish> ffs
[16:17:13] <Gruselbauer> not saying do not pick fights... just like, if you have to physically fight do mma, if you have to verbally fight pick fights with people at least as clever/strong as youz
[16:17:18] <carefish> all radiators work in my house
[16:17:21] <carefish> except the one in my room
[16:17:35] <carefish> and i already checked if there was air in the system
[16:17:36] <downboy> lol carefish, thats a bugger
[16:17:45] <carefish> now trying w/ all radiators off except my room
[16:17:52] <carefish> maybe enough pressure builds up 
[16:17:53] <alpaca> HELLO

[16:18:41] <Gruselbauer> :L
[16:18:42] <KillerBong> naaa
[16:18:46] <alpaca> i dont even know what he looks like
[16:18:51] <KillerBong> grusel is a thin heroin guy
[16:18:53] <alpaca> but i am not a favored winner in most matches
[16:18:54] <downboy> noticed when you get drunk with beer, its more not as agressive as vodka and other 40% vol alcohols
[16:18:56] <KillerBong> ur snap him in half
[16:19:05] <downboy> heh
[16:19:05] <Gruselbauer> lol KillerBong i am the opposite of that
[16:19:08] <KillerBong> oh
[16:19:12] <downboy> let me rephrase it :d
[16:19:17] <downboy> its less agressive*
[16:19:20] <KillerBong> i picture you as long and thin
[16:19:25] <KillerBong> not fat and short
[16:19:25] <Gruselbauer> 187/105 and broad shoulders
[16:19:30] <KillerBong> you have to be tall at least
[16:19:39] <Gruselbauer> more a bit of the viking type ^^
[16:19:45] <Gruselbauer> though beardless
[16:19:49] <azk> hops are sedative to a point
[16:19:51] <Gruselbauer> so not really
[16:20:09] <KillerBong> dammit
[16:20:11] <Gruselbauer> azk: yup. sold as sleeping pills here, hops pills.
[16:20:19] <KillerBong> my view of you is crushed Gruselbauer 
[16:20:24] <azk> Gruselbauer: nice
[16:20:31] <KillerBong> you used to be thin at least?
[16:20:33] <Gruselbauer> KillerBong: I will live in shame now

[16:21:21] <Gruselbauer> alpaca: though i mean, we would so not be getting in a fight
[16:21:27] <alpaca> no
[16:21:28] <KillerBong> okay grusel would kill alpaca 
[16:21:32] <alpaca> we would be yelling cool things at each other
[16:21:38] <alpaca> like "DID YOU SEE THAT ONE MOVIE"
[16:21:41] <alpaca> "YEAH IT WAS AWESOME"
[16:21:45] <alpaca> "HIGH FIVE FUCKER"
[16:21:49] <Gruselbauer> i am pretty chill unless you either get me raging on absolute purpose or so much as touch a friend funny
[16:21:57] <Gruselbauer> yeah that is my exact idea 
[16:22:22] <alpaca> you should meet my friend luke, he just moved back here from goettingen
[16:22:24] <KillerBong> slew: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJPz-oRnRDE

[19:38:16] <CthulhuChaos> nope!
[19:38:19] <alpaca> thats also insanely inaccurate
[19:38:27] <alpaca> phone mics are wildly inaccurate
[19:38:35] <alpaca> phone to phone
[19:38:39] <alpaca> and even the same device
[19:38:43] <alpaca> no way a db meter works on a phone
[19:38:57] <alpaca> its like using your sense of smell to detect abv
[19:39:00] <alpaca> "well, its there..."
[19:39:11] <Gruselbauer> hahaha
[19:39:13] <Gruselbauer> exactly

[19:45:02] <caitlin> my shirt thing could have made the whole deal profitable but they were too dumb 
[19:45:25] <CthulhuChaos> alpaca, 1/2 the band retired (for the 2016 tour last year) but the new guys are just as good
[19:45:55] <CthulhuChaos> they still have the main lead guitarist in the band
[19:46:03] <Gruselbauer> caitlin: what is your shirt thing? give me that shirt thing
[19:46:09] <Gruselbauer> shirts with artist stuffs?

[21:02:24] <Grenwolth> He was a droid from Mass Effect
[21:02:35] <embri0n> there was a hint to that on the first episode
[21:02:55] <embri0n> i liked the way they did it... doesnt look like an average show 
[21:03:34] <embri0n> better than many super hero shows out there 
[21:04:08] <Grenwolth> Ultraman was better than most, as was Underdog.
[21:05:42] <embri0n> never heard of those
[21:06:35] <embri0n> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4651924/
[21:06:45] <embri0n> that one?

[21:07:39] <Grenwolth> that's not right...

[21:08:21] <slew> legion had some great quips in mass effect
[21:08:57] <slew> was my 3rd favourite character after mordin and kasumi
[21:15:15] <caitlin> Anelines tshirt would come out looking pretty cool, i note
[21:15:25] <caitlin> spelled better than i just did it anyway
[21:17:19] <caitlin> I'm naked
[21:17:22] <Grenwolth> Cutting edge FX!
[21:17:48] <Grenwolth> oh christ! Cover up your shame!
[21:18:36] <caitlin> oh, ok
[21:18:49] <embri0n> wait, let us assess
[21:19:09] <Grenwolth> post a pic so we can discuss it
[21:19:25] <caitlin> oh wait, i lied.. i had a hairband on my left wrist and a wedding ring on my wedding ring finger, so not quite naked
[21:19:32] <Grenwolth> let's not rush to judgement here
[21:19:32] <caitlin> also no bollocks so not even bollock naked
[21:19:57] <caitlin> so my shame may have been on my ring finger or left wrist and actually may have been covered all the time
[21:19:59] <caitlin> who knows?
[21:20:19] <Grenwolth> more importantly, who  cares?
[21:20:27] <caitlin> this^
[21:22:43] <Grenwolth> Yes! Ultraman\s secret identity was Hyata!
[21:23:14] <Grenwolth> I think that's japanese for "douchebag."

[21:50:54] <embri0n> movie? 
[21:51:17] <Grenwolth> yeah
[21:51:27] <embri0n> its a good one 
[21:52:49] <Grenwolth> Hacksaw Ridge was p good
[21:53:23] <Gruselbauer> genitalism
[21:54:48] <Grenwolth> I'm guessing Stan Lee didn't see comic books being this profitable when he got into them.
[21:58:01] <Gruselbauer> lol i am guessing nobody did until early 2000s
[21:58:14] <Gruselbauer> like, 30-40y of cartoons and b-grade tv shows
[21:58:22] <Gruselbauer> then boom, superhero franchise megamovies
[22:00:42] <Grenwolth> You think he ever said "I wanna be rich like those guys at DC!" before the first Superman movie?
[22:01:26] <Gruselbauer> probably not
[22:01:46] <Gruselbauer> and hey, the guy got filthy rich using his imagination instead of robbing people of their savings, so more power to him
[22:03:19] <Grenwolth> Just so long as he's Trump donor.
[22:04:00] <caitlin> ged dmx is annoying
[22:10:31] <Gruselbauer> dextrometorphan or that rapper?
[22:14:07] <Gruselbauer> mhhh the ".app" pseudofolder idea is kinda neat in macos
[22:15:09] <caitlin> error 5 in libQtCore.so.4.8.7
[22:15:12] <caitlin> fuck this shit
[22:21:28] <Gruselbauer> aren't .so libraries or something in c or something?
[22:21:37] <Gruselbauer> i have really less than a percent of your nerd prowess
[22:27:01] Action: Gruselbauer plays the air guitar very much like somebody who has never played guitar in his life to Modest Mouse - Dark Center of the Universe
[22:28:56] <azk> sweet
[22:34:31] <Gruselbauer> Pixies - The Holiday Song
[22:37:10] <Gruselbauer> you know what is really crazy? the best german music - like the only stuff i can listen to - is politically extremist music
[22:37:34] <Gruselbauer> no idea why though, and the right wing extremist stuff is only funny in small dosages
[22:42:16] <Grenwolth> So I finally boughtt a new laptop batteru and SSD. Testing how long it lasts watching a movie on VLC
[22:45:20] <Gruselbauer> 10 minutes
[22:47:53] <Grenwolth> 16 now, old one would be dead, but would usually good enough to move it and plug iit back in.
[22:51:44] <Gruselbauer> shit that's worn down as fuck
[22:51:58] <Gruselbauer> mbp lasts like six hours now doing whatever the fuck i please
[22:52:05] <Gruselbauer> well except game
[22:52:09] <Gruselbauer> but, like, why bother
[22:53:58] <Grenwolth> I'm not usually ver9y far from a plus, but I wanna know I can be

[22:55:49] <[_]> just gay ansi art.
[22:55:58] <Grenwolth> then Gruselbauer won't be there long
[22:56:31] <[_]> the 'stereogram' image of yuri is the least gay of the bunch.
[22:57:06] <Grenwolth> not actually looking at it. just loaded it.

[23:03:55] <azk> lol
[23:04:34] <slew> interesting how japanese car makers name cars they can't pronounce with a japanese accent
[23:04:46] <slew> mazda roadster = mazuda loadastar
[23:05:11] <azk> mazuda ell ex sevenu
[23:05:25] <slew> effa dee actually
[23:05:42] <slew> and its matsuda i just messed it up
[23:07:00] <Gruselbauer> what is that called? like their weird half-english?
[23:07:33] <slew> its just english in a japanese accent
[23:07:52] <Gruselbauer> no fucking way the write that shit out like that
[23:08:00] <slew> just watching redline without a dub was funny because they can't say "red" and "line" without messing up r's and l's
[23:08:01] <Gruselbauer> misteru slew-san
[23:08:10] <rscott> the weirder part is naming their japanese company after a zorosatorian christ equivalent
[23:08:22] <Gruselbauer> a what now?
[23:08:22] <slew> a lot of japanese companies do that though
[23:08:26] <rscott> mazda
[23:08:28] <slew> sony isn't a japanese word
[23:08:50] <rscott> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda
[23:08:51] <Gruselbauer> neither is dickbutler
[23:09:03] <rscott> their logo is a flame
[23:09:08] <rscott> so it isn't an accident either
[23:09:12] <Gruselbauer> they butle your dick

[23:10:12] <rscott> i guess it comes down to the japanese love of puns
[23:10:59] <slew> idk if its got a name Gruselbauer but its because of the way the japanese language doesn't like consonants next to each other
[23:11:03] <slew> so they put vowels between them
[23:11:32] <slew> it carries over to the way they pronounce english words
[23:11:53] <Gruselbauer> yeah they are a stupid people and that's why they lost the war, that's my interpretation
[23:12:20] <slew> stupid people that lost the war, got nuked twice and yet managed a higher gdp per capita and a higher life expectancy than everyone
[23:12:30] <slew> also unlike us their trains run on time
[23:12:38] <Grenwolth> They started before teh Gemans and lasted .comlonger.
[23:13:02] <slew> they have giant robots too so i think that just makes them better
[23:13:13] <Grenwolth> Just something I noticed...
[23:13:52] <slew> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0bN-T6wuQU
[23:13:53] <Gruselbauer> if they cannot speak proper english, they have to stay outside of the wall
[23:13:55] <Gruselbauer> #maga
[23:13:56] <slew> robotochaaan
[23:15:50] <Grenwolth> You can come ovler anytime you want Gru You're white. What could be more fair than that?
[23:16:19] <Gruselbauer> i am totally down for that
[23:16:25] <Gruselbauer> i wanna have a second amendment
[23:16:32] <Gruselbauer> and own like thirteen grenade launchers
[23:16:42] <slew> 13 is an unlucky number in america
[23:16:48] <Gruselbauer> just seriously fuck shit up for motherfuckers who annoy me
[23:16:55] <slew> you should have 13 grenade launchers but say you have 14
[23:17:08] <Gruselbauer> or just have 14?
[23:17:09] <slew> thats what they do with their floor numbers after all
[23:17:19] <Gruselbauer> silly yankees
[23:17:32] <slew> do germans start at ground floor or at 1st floor
[23:17:54] <Gruselbauer> ground is "EG" for Erdgeschoss, then comest 1st floor
[23:18:01] <Gruselbauer> or -1st ^^
[23:18:05] <slew> oh good you do it sensibly
[23:18:20] <slew> silly yankees start at 1st floor it makes it very confusing
[23:18:33] <azk> 0 index floor
[23:19:20] <Gruselbauer> yeah that makes more sense, or 0 is minus one and shit
[23:19:25] <Gruselbauer> holy hell that is confusing
[23:19:52] <slew> but we also don't name the floor under ground floor -1
[23:19:57] <slew> we name it lower ground because fuck you
[23:20:03] <slew> and below that is sub basement
[23:20:09] <azk> That's awful
[23:20:29] <azk> and tbh, the american way is more logical.
[23:20:36] <azk> the ground floor is still a floor.
[23:20:38] <slew> so whats floor 0 in america
[23:20:45] <slew> if they call floor 1 the ground
[23:20:52] <slew> also the word floor looks weird to me now
[23:20:58] <slew> flour flooor
[23:20:59] <azk> Haha
[23:21:04] <azk> fleur de floor
[23:21:08] <slew> flueerr
[23:21:27] <azk> foolery with flour on the floor

[23:26:31] <azk> don't worry, denmark will be flooded by then.
[23:26:40] <slew> its already happened
[23:26:48] <slew> look at whats happening across europe mate
[23:27:04] <slew> look at evacuation of pacific islands
[23:27:13] <slew> this is not decades away its happening now
[23:27:40] <rscott> less than 30 years for certain
[23:27:54] <rscott> denmark, holland

[23:28:02] <rscott> gonna be fucked
[23:28:09] <slew> except the netherlands
[23:28:18] <rscott> you think so?
[23:28:21] <azk> They're already below sea level
[23:28:34] <slew> the other countries merely adopted the sea, the netherlands was born in it
[23:28:44] <rscott> lol
[23:28:47] <slew> they didn't see land until they were grown up and by then it was FLOODING

[23:30:33] <zen> i'm not so much thinking about us.. more like 200 mill ppl from areas arond Bangladesh having to move
[23:30:35] <rscott> that's pretty awful
[23:30:40] <rscott> right
[23:30:50] <rscott> that's going to basically collapse global civilization
[23:31:01] <slew> flooding in bangladesh has also been happening for years now
[23:31:14] <rscott> it's gonna get worse
[23:31:16] <azk> We'll see
[23:31:20] <rscott> glaciers drying up
[23:31:22] <rscott> no water
[23:31:24] <Gruselbauer> zen: i am gonna welcome them with german friendliness and offer the traditional showering experience first
[23:31:27] <slew> the thing is thats where the poor people live
